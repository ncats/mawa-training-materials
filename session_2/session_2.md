Unsupervised clustering provides several advantages over traditional manual annotation of the cell types. All images in the dataset can be evaluated together and it helps to reduce personally introduced bias. Unsupervised clustering workflow primarily consists of two steps, construction of the neighborhood graph and evaluation of the graph with a community detection algorithm.
