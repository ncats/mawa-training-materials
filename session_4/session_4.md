## Concepts

### Review Data Ingestion/Unification

![MAWA Welcome Screen](../session_4/images/MAWA_welcome.jpg)

When you first open MAWA, you are going to see a Welcome Screen that looks like this. To start your data ingestion journey, you will click on the button labeled *Data Import and Export*

![MAWA Import and Export](../session_4/images/MAWA_import.jpg)

At the top of the page, you will see two tables, one labeled as Available Input on NIDAP, and another labeled as Input Data in MAWA. There will be two buttons positioned between these tables. The table on the left displays all data available on NIDAP that could be imported in MAWA. Verify that you can find all your necessary files in this left-hand table.

### Introduction to Neighborhood Profiles

When we were in the early stage of developing MAWA, we worked with Will Heinz of the OMAL group about how we might implement methods from a recent publication.

### MAWA Demo of Neighborhood Profiles

So, everything I recapped in the beginning are necessary steps to start using Neighborhood Profiles
