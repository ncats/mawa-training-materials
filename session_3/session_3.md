## Concepts

![Slide1](full/Slide1.PNG)

We will demonstrate how to use hypothesis testing in MAWA to learn about the spatial distributions of two species of cells on a slide to get insight into how the cells interact.

![Slide3](full/Slide3.PNG)

![Slide4](full/Slide4.PNG)

![Slide5](full/Slide5.PNG)

Note that the coordinates of the cells are the same as in the previous image, but the colors are randomly permuted.

![Slide6](full/Slide6.PNG)

![Slide7](full/Slide7.PNG)

So, for the 5 permutations, we have T* = [13, 15, 14, 9, 12].

![Slide8](full/Slide8.PNG)

Now we will review the usual method for calculating P values relative to a known null distribution of a statistic T such as the one above.
